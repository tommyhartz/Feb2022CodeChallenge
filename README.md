Problem:

To try and encourage more sales of the 5 different products they sell, RevLocal has decided to offer discounts of multiple-product purchases.

One quantity of any of the five products A,B,C,D,E costs $299.

If, however, you buy two different products, you get a 5% discount on those two products.

If you buy 3 different products, you get a 10% discount.

If you buy 4 different products, you get a 20% discount.

If you go the whole hog, and buy all 5, you get a huge 25% discount.

Note that if you buy, say, four products, of which 3 are different, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth product still costs $299.

Your mission is to write a piece of code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping cart (containing only products), giving as big a discount as possible.

Notes It needs to be written using JavaScript

Your code should accept an array as input, and should return a number, as follow:

function computeTotalPrice(productsArray) { // code to be executed }

For example, given the following array input for parameter products: ['A','A','B','B','C','C','D','E']

This would represent a shopping cart containing: 2 quantity of product A 2 quantity of product B 2 quantity of product C 1 quantity of product D 1 quantity of product E

Answer: $1,928.55

Prices with discounts for sets of items: 0% = 299.00 x 1 = 299.00 5% = 284.05 x 2 = 568.10 10% = 269.10 x 3 = 807.30 20% = 239.20 x 4 = 956.80 25% = 224.25 x 5 = 1121.25

Each unique set of 2 or more items gets its own discount rate.
